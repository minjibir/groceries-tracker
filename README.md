In an attempt to track our expenses in order to make an informed decision for the day-to-day groceries, we need a simple application that could help us keep track of each receipt of a given purchase.

We intend to keep it simple by tracking just the name, price, barcode of each item. And for each purchase associated a given receipt we collect only the list of items, receipt number, total amount, and the date of the purchase.
